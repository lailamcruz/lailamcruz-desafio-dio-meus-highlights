Hello! Welcome to my highlights on the book The Art of War :wave:

6. On which side are officers and men more highly trained?

7. In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?

Posição 62

*Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.*

Posição 67

If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.

## **2. Waging War**

Posição 82

**If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.**

Posição 87

(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.

(5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.

Posição 156

*Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.*

## **4. Tactical Dispositions**

Posição 161

The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.

Posição 163

***To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.***

Posição 180

Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory

## **6. Weak Points and Strong**

Posição 249

Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.

Posição 254

If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need to do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.
